# Accept a bounty

This guide will explain how contributors can accept an existing bounty by
creating a Github PR that references it.

## Start a pull-request

The process starts by creating a new PR. This PR can be from a branch in the
original repository or from a fork.

It's recommended to start as a draft PR to make it explicit that the task hasn't
been finished. It doesn't have to contain any code at this point, it can be just
an empty branch.

## Accept the bounty

Once you have created a PR, the next step is to link it to the existing bounty.
You can do this by adding a comment in the PR that starts with
`/githoney` and calls the `accept-bounty` command.

Since only one contributor can be linked to a bounty, it's recommended to do
this as early as possible in the process to avoid working on a task only to find
that that other contributor accepted the same bounty already.

The `accept-bounty` command has the following parameters:

- `contract`: the id of the contract of the bounty, which can be found as a
  comment in by the bot in the issue that describes the task.
- `address`: the Cardano wallet address that will be used to claim the reward if
  / when the PR get approved and merged.

Here's the example of the body of a comment that can be used to attach a bounty
that provides a reward of 500 ADA, that needs to fulfilled within 60 days and
that will be deposited from the address `addr1xxx`.

```
/githoney accept-bounty --contract abc111 --address addr1xxx
```

<Callout type="info">
  For detailed information on available commands please refer to the [Bot
  commands](./bot_commands) section of the documentation.
</Callout>

When the bot receives the command it provides acknowledgment by adding a +1
emoji to your comment.

At this stage is when the bot will send to you Cardano address a token that
represents the contributor role. The [on-chain contract](./onchain_contract)
will ensure that only the holder of this token is allowed to withdraw the
rewards for this bounty once the PR has been merged. You can check your wallet
after a few minutes to confirm the reception.
