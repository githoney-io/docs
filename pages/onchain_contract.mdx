# On-chain contract

The Bounty on-chain contract is implemented using
[Marlowe](https://marlowe.iohk.io/), in which a party (the Maintainer) can make
a payment to another party (the Contributor) by locking funds in the contract
and delegating the responsibility of unlocking the funds to a 3rd party (the
Bot).

Each bounty is it's own independent contract, usually refered to as peer-to-peer
contracts. Marlowe contracts provide several guarantees as part of the language
design, but having one contract per bounty limits the blast radious of any
security issues, which is a very good quality to have.

The bot is reponsible for submitting the contract on-chain and will initially
hold the role tokens for each of the other parites.

The Maintainer will first make a deposit into his account. After some external
criterion is met, the Admin can unlock the payment, moving the tokens from the
Maintainer’s account to the Developer’s account, and closing the contract. After
this, the Developer can withdraw their payment.
