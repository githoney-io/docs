organization. This will allow the bot to respond to commands to manage the
bounties.

Follow these steps to configure the app for your GitHub organization.

1. Head over to the GitHub app
   [installation page](https://github.com/apps/githoney-io)
2. Click on the **Install** button.
3. Choose your organization from the list where you want to install GitHoney.
4. Choose either all repositories or only the ones you're interested in applying
   bounties
5. Click the final "Install" button to confirm the process

<Callout type="info">
  This Github App only requires read access to metadata and read / write access
  to issues and pull requests. The install page should show values that match
  these requirements.
</Callout>

Congratulations! You've successfully installed and configured the GitHoney GitHub App for your organization. Now you can start using the app to
manage bounties for your open-source projects.
