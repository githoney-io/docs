# Bot Command reference

The GitHoney bot interactions can be thought as analogous to interacting
with a CLI, with the big difference that commands and outputs are expressed as
Github comments in the corresponding issue.

## `attach-bounty` command

This command can be executed on any Github issue. It should be used on issues
that describe the task to be accomplished.

### Args

- `amount`: the amount in ADA currency that the contributor that fulfills the
  bounty will get once the tasks has been fulfilled. The minimum value is 10 ADA.
- `deadline`: the time interval in days starting now that the contributor has available
  to fulfill the task. The minimum value is 6 days.
- `address` the address of the wallet that will be used to deposit the reward in
  the escrow contract.
- `network` the network on which the contract will be created. It only accepts
  two values `preprod` and `mainnet`. If this parameter is ignored, it will be
  set to "preprod" by default.

<Callout type="warning">
  If the address format does not match with the network, the contract creation
  will fail.
</Callout>

Here's the example of the body of a comment that can be used to attach a bounty
in mainnet that provides a reward of 5000 ADA, that needs to fulfilled within 60
days and that will be deposited from the address `addr1xxx`.

```
/githoney attach-bounty --amount 5000 --address addr1q9dmgalc57pqpehn3pmgexawztyrw2tckwhavpexpp35tsey05ppwrzmf2kmjwjecj30xtgfezzghtzmqkttyfu3ragqrlsz3d --deadline 60 --network mainnet
```

## `accept-bounty` command

This command allows contributors to accept a bounty and link a PR to it.

### Args

- `contract`: the id of the contract of the bounty, which can be found as a
  comment in by the bot in the issue that describes the task.
- `address`: the Cardano wallet address that will be used to claim the reward if
  / when the PR get approved and merged.

Here's the example of the body of a comment that can be used to attach a bounty
that provides a reward of 500 ADA, that needs to fulfilled within 60 days and
that will be deposited from the address `addr1xxx`.

```
/githoney accept-bounty --contract abc111 --address addr1xxx
```
